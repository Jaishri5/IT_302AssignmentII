            <p>NOVEL XP started in February 2024 with an IWT assignment to create a static HTML page. The website owner had an idea to connect
            readers with their passion for reading and provide collection of novels on a single website.</p>
            <p> The website was completed a week before the deadline.</p>
            <p>Its safe to say that the website creator has been succesful in acheiving both the goals ie; completing the assignment as well as igniting the passion for reading.</p>
