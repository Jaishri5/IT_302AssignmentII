                                <p>A Chinese proverb says, “Falling leaves return to their roots.” In her own courageous voice, Adeline Yen Mah returns to her roots to tell the story of her painful childhood and her ultimate triumph in the face of despair. 
                                    Adeline's affluent, powerful family considers her bad luck after her mother dies giving birth to her, and life does not get any easier when her father remarries.
                                     Adeline and her siblings are subjected to the disdain of her stepmother, while her stepbrother and stepsister are spoiled with gifts and attention. Although Adeline wins prizes at school, they are not enough to compensate for what she really yearns for
                                      -- the love and understanding of her family.
                                     Like the classic Cinderella story, this powerful memoir is a moving story of resilience and hope. </p>

                            <p>Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara's
                                older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college,
                                Tara decided to try a new kind of life.
                                Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents,
                                to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far,
                                if there was still a way home. </p>

                                <p>Maps have a mysterious hold over us. Whether ancient, crumbling parchments or generated by Google, maps tell us things we want to know, not only about our current location or where we are going but about the world in general. And yet, when it comes to geo-politics, much of what we are told is generated by analysts and other experts who have neglected to refer to a map of the place in question.
                                    All leaders of nations are constrained by geography. In “one of the best books about geopolitics” (The Evening Standard), now updated to include 2016 geopolitical developments,
                                    journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the US,
                                    Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan,
                                    Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic--their weather, seas,
                                    mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders--to provide a context often missing
                                    from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries
                                    affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.</p>
